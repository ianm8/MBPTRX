# BOM Notes

## Resistors
All SM resistors are 1206 thick film of at least 125mW except R77 which should be at least 500mW.

## Capacitors
All SM capacitors are 1206 NP0 or C0G except for the 22uF and 100uF capacitors.

## Inductors
All SM inductors are 1206 for as high SRF as possible (ie, greater than 30MHz).
